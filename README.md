Yandisa Belinda Katiya - Portfolio Website

My IDE of choice for this website was Visual Studio Code.
This website was created to showcase my talents, aspirations and development projects. To build it, I tapped into my web development reservoirs and coded it from scratch using JavaScript, jQuery, PHP, HTML, CSS and Bootstrap.
